            <p>In March 2014, Swift began living in New York City. Around this time, she worked on her fifth studio album, 1989.
            The album was released on October 27, 2014, and debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 with sales of 1.28 million copies in its first week.
            This made Swift the first act to have three albums sell more than one million copies in their opening week, for which she earned a Guinness World Record.
            By June 2017, 1989 had sold over 10 million copies worldwide. Its singles "Shake It Off", "Blank Space" and "Bad Blood" (featuring rapper Kendrick Lamar) reached number one in Australia, Canada and the U.S., the first two making Swift the first woman to replace herself at the top spot of the Hot 100.
            The singles "Style" and "Wildest Dreams" reached the top 10 in the U.S. Other singles were "Out of the Woods" and "New Romantics". The 1989 World Tour ran from May to December 2015 and was the highest-grossing tour of the year with $250 million in total revenue.
            Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.
            Swift and English singer Zayn Malik released a single together, "I Don't Wanna Live Forever", for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). The song reached number two in the U.S. and won Best Collaboration at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.
            After a one-year hiatus from the public spotlight, Swift cleared her social media accounts and released "Look What You Made Me Do" as the lead single from her sixth album, Reputation. The single was Swift's first U.K. number-one single. It topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.S.
            Reputation was released on November 10, 2017. It debuted at top the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.21 million copies.
            With this achievement, Swift became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the U.S. The album topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada. First-week worldwide sales amounted to two million copies.
            Reputation was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in 2019. At the American Music Awards of 2018, Swift won four awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist. After the 2018 AMAs, Swift garnered a total of 23 awards, becoming the most awarded female musician in AMA history.</p>

            <p>Swift released her seventh studio album, Lover, on August 23, 2019. Lover made Swift the first female artist to have a sixth consecutive album sell more than 500,000 copies in one week in the U.S.
            All 18 songs from the album charted on the Billboard Hot 100 the same week, setting a record for the most simultaneous entries by a woman. The lead single, "Me!", debuted at number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100 and rose to number two a week later, scoring the biggest single-week jump in chart history.
            The album earned accolades, including three nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020. At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, "Me!" won Best Visual Effects, and "You Need to Calm Down" won Video of the Year and Video for Good. Swift was the first female and second artist overall to win Video of the Year for a video that they directed.
            In 2020, Swift released two surprise albums to critical acclaim and commercial success. The first, her eighth studio album Folklore, was released on July 24. The second, her ninth studio album Evermore, was released on December 11.
            Both of the album were each supported by three singles each, catering to the U.S. mainstream radio, country radio, and triple A radio; the singles, in that order, were "Cardigan", "Betty", and "Exile" from Folklore, and "Willow", "No Body, No Crime", and "Coney Island" from Evermore. "Cardigan" and "Willow", opened at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 the same week their parent albums debuted atop the Billboard 200.
            Swift was 2020's highest-paid musician in the U.S., and the world's highest-paid solo musician.
            At the 2020 American Music Awards, Swift won three awards, including Artist of the Year for a record third consecutive time. Folklore won Album of the Year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making Swift the first woman to win the award thrice.</p>

            <p>Swift released two re-recorded albums in 2021, adding "Taylor's Version" to their titles. The first, Fearless (Taylor's Version), peaked atop the Billboard 200, becoming the first re-recorded album to do so.
            It was preceded by the three tracks: "Love Story (Taylor's Version)", "You All Over Me" with Maren Morris, and "Mr. Perfectly Fine", the first of which made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and the re-recording of a single reach number one on the Hot Country Songs chart.
            The second re-recording Red (Taylor's Version) was released on November 12.  She was the highest-paid female musician of 2021, and both her 2020 albums and the re-recordings were ranked among the 10 best-selling albums of the year.
