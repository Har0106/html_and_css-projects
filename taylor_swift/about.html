            After a one-year hiatus from the public spotlight, Swift cleared her social media accounts and released "Look What You Made Me Do" as the lead single from her sixth album, Reputation. The single was Swift's first U.K. number-one single. It topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.S.
            Reputation was released on November 10, 2017. It debuted at top the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.21 million copies.
