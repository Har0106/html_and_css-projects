                <p>Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.</p>

                        <p>A low-level language is a programming language that deals with a computer's hardware components and constraints. Low-level languages are machine-friendly. They are, thus, very difficult to understand and learn by any human. Generally, this refers to either machine code or assembly language.</p>
                        <h3>Machine Language</h3>
                        <p>Machine language is made out of binary numbers such as 0s and 1s or bits that can only be read by machines. These binary digits are understood and read by a computer system and interpreted easily. It is fast in operation.</p>
                        <h3>Assembly Language</h3>
                        <p>An assembly language is intended to communicate directly with a computer's hardware. Assembly languages are designed to be readable by humans. Assembly langauge should be translated to instructions using assembler</p>

                        <pa>A high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. High-level languages are human-friendly. They are, thus, very easy to understand and learn by any programmer.</pa>

                <p>Markup languages like XML, HTML, or troff, which define structured data, are not usually considered programming languages. Programming languages may, however, share the syntax with markup languages if a computational semantics is defined.</p>
