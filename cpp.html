                <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. C++ is a fast and strongly-typed programming language which makes it an ideal choice for developing operating systems. Mac OS X has large amounts written in C++. Most of the software from Microsoft like Windows, Microsoft Office, IDE Visual Studio, and Internet Explorer are also written in C++.</p>
