                    <li>Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln, in a log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky.</li>
                    <li>Lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in Kentucky and was raised on the frontier, primarily in Indiana.</li>
                    <li>He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. Congressman from Illinois.</li>
                    <li>Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North to gain victory.</li>
                    <li>In 1863 he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the slaves in the states "in rebellion" to be free. It also directed the Army and Navy to "recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons" and to receive them "into the armed service of the United States".</li>
                    <li>Lincoln also pressured border states to outlaw slavery, and he promoted the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which upon its ratification abolished slavery.</li>
                    <li>Lincoln managed his own successful re-election campaign. He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation.</li>
                    <li> On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at Appomattox, he was attending a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., with his wife Mary when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth.</li>
                    <li> Abraham Lincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery.</li>
                    <li>Lincoln is often ranked in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in American history.</li>
