                <p>C is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. C is an imperative procedural language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system.</p>
